# scuffed-dogecoin-scraper-and-RNN
don't judge me on how i programmed this

anyway,

welcome to my small "for fun" project. the intention behind this is to have a scraper that gathers dogecoin's value history and then use it to train a neural network that hopefully can at least predict whether dogecoin will rise or drop in value. not predicting the exact price, but only to train it to see if it will rise or not.

i'm not an expert at both scraping and neural network, mainly neural network. if you have any suggestion on how to improve either, do let me know and be patience with my lack of knowledge in both fields.

this isn't finished yet. when it is, you'll see this line disappear.
